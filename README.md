This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects focused on solving real-world business and analytical problems.
Each project includes clean, well-structured notebooks, synthetic or anonymized datasets, and clear documentation of the modeling workflow.

The goal of this repository is to consolidate my work in ML across multiple domains such as credit risk, forecasting, classification, data quality, and exploratory analytics.
